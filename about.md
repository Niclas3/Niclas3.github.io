This is a coder , you can call me niclas.

I love Vim and kernel-related things, and I also have a personal project
called [Frog](https://github.com/Niclas3/Frog) , which is a 32bit x86 operating system. 

I am curious about everything I will write about many topics in this blog.

一个开发，做过前端，写过操作系统，有一些好奇心。
